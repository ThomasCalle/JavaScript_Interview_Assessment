## Description

JavaScript Interview Assessment

The purpose of the module named "JavaScript Interview Assessment" is to asses fellow Full Stack Developers or to challenge newly focused JavaScript users by taking a 'Moderate' level interview assesment - in order to gauge the usesrs comprehension, applied knowledge and preperatory studies to fulfil real-world interview challenges. The prupose is have this app run in the browser, feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. The quiz has clean and minimal layout with a responsive user interface and provides the 'true or false' questions followed by a 'Leaderboard' prompt to submit the users achieved score - the score will be presented on the main page once logged.

## Overview

### The challenge

This module Challenge involves building a timed coding quiz named "JavaScript Interview Assessment" and it will have multiple-choice questions. The prupose is have this app run in the browser, feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. The quiz has clean and minimal layout with a responsive user interface.

## My process


I initialized and configured a GitHub repository to maintain version control for this project. The project utilizes GitHub pages to easily publish this project for other to view. 

Once complete, brainstorm a presentable 'coding quiz' game layout which includes: title, difficulty level header, local leader board stored on page with the abiility to input the users score once the game has been compelted, click button to intiate game, styled design footer trade marking the creater: Thomas Calle(ME)

Once brainstormed, generalize all navigational tools to the following assets nessacary - ensure suitable loads and presented items are provided. Ideally the quiz is to function in a drop down menu which presents the timer.

The process has been my first true implimentation of JavaScript including the following inputed functions; variables, prompts, tracking, record keeping, loops and formated HTML combined together. The application is functional when deployed, accessibility screen resizing from desktop to mobile format, with a responsive layout that adapts to the various viewports... creates an ease of access and overall pollished and minimal user base experience, as it demostrates easy flow and optimizes efficient user experience.

Initially my creations always start with an HTML backbone... proceeeded to the styles adding header footers with soft minimal designs and flex boxes. The Java script provided the main functionality once the layout and design was done more thoughtout testing and finalization was made for the quiz game such as quiz clock, questions, intials and score etc.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Functional JavaScript on a 'applied and 'moderate' creation difficulty
- CSS custom properties minimal desiqn
- Mobile-first workflow and accesability
- Comments - clear indicators and point reference marks
- Images, sourced locally, images/photos created by the author (Thomas Calle)
- Additiional resource links provided.

### What I learned

I learned the necessity to  provide the client with minimal and controlled layout with optimizaed JavaScript based on a DRY METHOD. This allowed me to create ease of access and user base as well back-end experience managment to better communicate and address the functionality and process of what's going on.

Grasping the implimentation of JavaScript on a moderate to adavanced level - within 3 days of intial start date experience was able to get over the hurdle of the exhasusting preciseness and specification of inputs. One improperly logged code would break the entire system so proper formation and commands are paramount over the style. If I had to revist this project - would approach from a minimal HTML back bone then proceed with heavy JavaScript focus over CSS to ensure proper results and no back peddling on the brainstorm board.

Experience milestone: use of JavaScript for the first time every especially among a published and completed project.

Understanding the critical requirements necessary to develop a quiz game and other mock-ups will always be my focus in order to satisfy requested work from colleaguess, clients, and employers a like. 


### Continued development

Throughout my journey, will evaluate my JavaScript experience among theory and practice to better my efficency - to take it up a notch, to push the envelope, and of course to further my pursuit of happiness.
